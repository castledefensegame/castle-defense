# Castle Defense

    The battle has yet to begin. Both sides are gathering resources, training troops, 
    and forming battle strategies to prepare themselves for the upcoming attack.
    The attackers are formulating battle formations, strategies, and tactics that the
    defenders won't expect, all the while the defenders are expecting and preparing for the worst.
    One single mistake could be the deciding deciding factor for the battle - and just maybe of the entire war...

(work in progress)

**Castle Defense** is a third person multiplayer game with two teams â€“ one defending an objective and one attacking it. The attacking team is given a time limit and 10 lives to attack an objective, which is being protected by the defending team. If the attacking team succeeds in destroying the objective, they win. If they run out of lives or time, the defenders win. 

---------------------------------------------------

There are different classes that can be used to give either team an edge:


Swordsman - All-around class, with a single sword

Knight - Lots of health & damage, but very slow

Archer - Shoot arrows over long ranges that deal a lot of damage

Assassin - Weaker class, but very fast

Mage - Cast different spells to harm the other team & help your own
