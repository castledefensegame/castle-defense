# Castle-Defense

(work in progress)

**Castle Defense** is a third person multiplayer game with two teams â€“ one defending an objective and one attacking it. The attacking team is given a time limit and 10 lives to attack an objective, which is being protected by the defending team. If the attacking team succeeds in destroying the objective, they win. If they run out of lives or time, the defenders win. 

---------------------------------------------------

There are different classes that can be used to give either team an edge:
----
Swordsman - All-around class, with a single sword

Knight - Lots of health & damage, but very slow

Archer - Shoot arrows over long ranges that deal a lot of damage

Assassin - Weaker class, but very fast

Mage - Cast different spells to harm the other team & help your own
